# elevator-saga

This is my solution to the problem at http://www.elevatorsaga.com/ .  It has been an intersting vehicle for me 
to learn javascript beyond just syntax.  The current algorthm does not pass all cases.  There is no ideal algorithm
to guarnatee success at all levels: http://www.columbia.edu/~cs2035/courses/ieor4405.S13/p14.pdf.  When I have time,
I continue to improve upon what I've done.  I hope to reach an algorithm that passes each level a majority of times in 
10 consequtive runs.
